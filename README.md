# Meshworks

Visual Art experiments with the canvas element and node connections.

Variations can be obtained by adjusting the following vars:
	- `countPoints` is the number of randomly created nodes
	- `connectionDepth` is the number of connections each node will create with other nodes. Connections begin with the nearest node and proceed in order of distance. Grayscale values progressively lighten with each level of connection.
